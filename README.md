# Breast Cancer Prediction
Cancer, Rodríguez Larumbe  appeared as a result of mutations or abnormal changes in the genes responsible for regulating the growth of cells and keeping them grow healthily. The genes are in each cell’s nucleus, representing the “control room” of each cell. Normally, the cells in our bodies replace themselves through an orderly process of cell growth: healthy new cells take place, and the older ones die, but mutations can “turn on” and turn off certain genes in a cell, which gives the cells the ability to keep dividing without producing more cells identical to the original cell which leads to forming a tumor. A tumor, Rodríguez Larumbe [1], can be less dangerous in the beginning. These tumors are not considered cancerous: their cells are close to normal, they grow slowly, and they do not invade close tissues or other parts of the body. However, malignant tumors are cancerous. If they are left unchecked, malignant cells eventually can spread out of the original host to other tissues of the body. Breast cancer is a type of cancer which forms in the tissue of the breasts’ cells, Clinic [23]; Boa. The symptoms of breast cancer, Board [3], may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast volume and form, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or red color or scaly patch of skin. This type of cancer is an uncontrolled growth of breast cells. Statistically, breast cancer is ranked the second most fatal disease worldwide for women, Group et al. [4]. According to the report of the statistics of the World Health Organization [5], 627,000 women died from breast cancer in 2018. This death number accounts nearly for 15% of all deaths because of cancer among women. In the Western part of the world, previous research has indicated that one of every nine women is likely to develop breast cancer in the course of their lives [6]. For all these reasons together, there is continuous requirement for a robust and accurate system that works as a tool for early diagnosis and detection of breast cancer diseases to lower the number of demises and increase the number of survivors from this disease, through accurate distinguishing between benign and malignant breast tumors.

When it comes to data science applications, the healthcare environment is one of the most appealing data sources due to the tremendous amount of available data and the sustainable nature of data. Each hospital has a dataset that is constantly increasing with time. Improving the healthcare system is a noble goal that almost everybody is always after it. Data mining and machine learning techniques can lead to direct improvement in the healthcare system.

Recently, machine learning algorithms have been playing an essential role in predicting breast cancer. For example, Asri et al. [7] applied different machine learning classification algorithms such as support vector machine, decision tree, naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbors on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset to predict breast cancer. Moreover, Aloraini [8] compared five classification learning algorithms, including Bayesian network, naïve Bayes, decision trees J4.8, ADTree, and multilayer neural network, to classify benign cancer or malignant cancer from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. Besides this, the hybrid method is a new technique that is used to reduce the number of features using feature selection methods to enhance the performance of machine learning models. For example, Akay [9] introduced a hybrid technique, which is a combination of the support vector machine integrated with feature selection for breast cancer diagnosis. Zheng et al. [10] extracted features using a hybrid of K-means with support vector machine algorithms to predict breast cancer.

Nowadays, a new source of data has become a challenging task to process and store using traditional database storage and has been playing a pivotal role in many fields such as health, industry, and making decisions, which is streaming data. Streaming data are generated continuously by different sources of data such as social networks, sensors, and mobile devices. For processing streaming data, researchers used big data platforms such as Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop [11], Apache Kafka [12], and Apache Storm [13] to store, analyze, and process streaming data. For example, Zhang et al. [14] proposed a new task-level adaptive MapReduce framework to apply real-time streaming data in healthcare applications. Nair et al. [15] used a machine learning model to predict heart disease from streaming tweets based on Apache Spark. The ultimate goal of an effective healthcare system is saving people’s lives, lessening of hospitalization periods, and providing better application of preventative care. Recently, real-time streaming analytic technologies offer significant improvement toward achieving this goal. Streaming analytic methods along with the Internet of Things (IOT) have enabled healthcare providers to observe trends and patterns faster than ever by analyzing the data on a real-time basis. Building such patterns enhances the decision-making process by the application of predictive analytics. The implementation of these techniques not only results in the reduction of the required workload by the nurses and doctors but also results in a general improvement of the patient care and lowers the needed cost for the healthcare appointments. Top hospitals around the world are employing data analytic methods over data streams for various medical fields such as internal and neurological medicine for adults and neonatal care for kids. Massive amount of medical data is available for processing on a real-time basis without requiring the healthcare provider to visit the patient’s place. Multiple sensors and devices are generating data every second such as clinical alarms and vital signs’ monitoring. Accessing the medical data as it happens in the same moment, then analyzing them, and visualizing their results facilitate the healthcare providers’ task in detecting early signs of illness which leads to reduction of the healthcare cost in general. The main factor to achieve such a goal is the implementation of data analytic techniques on streaming data collected from multiple sources. Nowadays, social networks are used extensively as a health support tool in increasing the health awareness of the community on top of spreading the medical updates and current recommendations when a crisis happens. Social media data can be a useful part if added to the healthcare database; this could improve both diagnosis [16] and clinical decisions [17]. Also, social media adds a new dimension to healthcare by utilizing real-time patients’ data to detect early breast cancer because social media, especially Twitter, is rich in medical information used increasingly for health and medical goals, including sharing information about diabetes [18], identifying the effective adverse drug [19], analyzing breast cancer [20], and other benefits. Also, Twitter Streaming API allows researchers to read streaming data in real time. Therefore, researchers can integrate Twitter with big data streaming tools to develop applications that work in real time such as [15, 21]. In this paper, the problem of predicting breast cancer using a set of streaming data collected from users’ health data from Twitter is addressed. The previous studies of breast cancer prediction have focused only on predicting breast cancer based on historical data and traditional machine learning algorithms to solve this problem. These studies do not predict breast cancer in real time using streaming data that are collected from social networks. The goal of this work is predicting breast cancer in real time from patients’ social posts based on machine learning algorithms that are integrated with Apache Spark and Apache Kafka. The real-time predicting breast cancer system consists of two components: developing an offline model and online prediction pipeline. In the developing an offline model component, distributed machine learning algorithms, namely, decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR), based on Apache Spark are used to train and test models to a Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) database (BCWD) to select the best model that is used to predict breast cancer in real time. For the online prediction pipeline, patient’s tweets are collected by Apache Kafka from Twitter. Also, Apache Spark is used to preprocess the data in real time. Our contributions could be reviewed in
